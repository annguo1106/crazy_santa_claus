# Crazy Santa Claus

## Overview
This is the final project of Introduction to Computer Graph in 2024 fall semester. This project is designed to recreate a magical and whimsical Christmas scene featuring a "Crazy Santa Claus." The goal is to demonstrate creative use of vertex shaders, fragment shaders, geometry shaders, cubemap transitions, and animations to deliver a visually appealing and interactive experience.

## Project Structure
```
- CMakeLists       # Main build configuration file for CMake
- src/             # Source code files, including the core project implementation
- extern/          # External libraries and dependencies
- build/           # Directory for compiled files (generated by CMake)
- .vscode/         # Configuration files for VSCode IDE
```

## Features
- **Explosive Christmas Tree**: A spinning Christmas tree explodes using geometry shaders for a dynamic visual effect.
- **Interactive Santa Claus**: Santa can transform into different states (rainbow, melting, waving, etc.) controlled by keyboard inputs.
- **Day and Night Transitions**: The scene transitions between day and night with cubemap-based lighting and atmospheric effects.
- **Snowfall Simulation**: Colorful snowballs and falling snow enhance the festive atmosphere.
- **Custom Animations**: Santa performs unique animations such as waving and melting into water.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

2. **Build the Project:**
   Create a `build` directory and use CMake to generate the build files:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   After building the project, navigate to the `build/src` directory and execute the compiled binary:
   ```bash
   ./<executable-name>
   ```

## Controls
- `0`: Display Santa in his original form.
- `1`: Transform Santa into a rainbow version.
- `2`: Melt Santa into water.
- `3`: Show Santa as a water-like figure.
- `4`: Make Santa wave.
- `N`: Transition from day to night.
- `M`: Transition from night to day.
- `R`: Restart the scene from the Christmas tree.
- `T`: Restart the scene from Santa's appearance.

### Demo Steps
1. Wait until Santa appears.
2. Press `1` (Rainbow version).
3. Press `M` (Transition to day).
4. Press `N` (Transition to night).
5. Press `3` (Water version).
6. Press `M` (Transition to day).
7. Press `4` (Waving version).
8. Press `2` (Melting version).
